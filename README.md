# What is the project
All medical students in Egypt are used to listen to medical records from first year to the last years and also after graduation to remember an information.
So we designed this app to make it easy to reach any medical record you need in your journey through medical college for all your favorite doctors.
Itâ€™s important to say that all records are available on internet and we just make studying easy by bringing them all to one place.
